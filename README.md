<h1>Bachelor's project: Relationship between sustainability and profitability in the oil and gas industry in the European Union</h1>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

As we are living in a fast-paced world where every aspect of our lives is somehow affected by sustainability and issues related to sustainability, it is certainly an up-to-date topic to study the sustainability of firms and its relationship to other factors of businesses, such as the profitability. Therefore, this research aims to explore the relationship between sustainability and profitability in an industry that is traditionally not considered to be sustainable, which is the oil-and-gas industry with a regional scope in the European Union.
This research paper is meant to study whether the sustainability efforts of the companies are having a positive effect on their profitability and takes into account whether profitability can affect sustainability.


The base for the analysis is a 14-company sample that shows sustainability and financial data for each company for a 7-year period, which results in 98 observations.
Theory showed that the countries’ approach to sustainability can be interpreted from their renewable energy share in their total electricity output. Overall, this can have a positive effect on the sustainability of the companies as well.


To see if there is a correlation between the companies’ headquarter countries’ renewable energy share and the companies sustainability, that is measured by the Refinitiv Eikon’s Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) scores, a Spearman correlation was concluded. The result of the analysis showed that the two variables are moderately correlated.
Legitimacy theory showed that, in general, if companies are making sure that they are meeting the needs of society, it can reinforce their financial performance. However there are certain factors, such as greenwashing and the nature of the industry, that can have a diminishing effect profitability.


This theory was tested with a fixed effects panel data regression model, for which the net profit margin (NPM) was used as the dependent variable, and the ESG scores and the countries’ renewable energy shares as the independent variables; however the analysis of this research did not find the sustainability to affect the profitability positively.
A certain interpretation of the institutional theory says that profitability has a reinforcing effect on the sustainability, which was also tested with a fixed effects panel data regression model that confirmed this view.


Even though this research could not specifically explore how can sustainability-focused companies can also achieve financial profitability, it was able to conclude that the countries’ level of renewable energy use is positively affecting the companies’ sustainability and to confirm that the financially strong years are positively influencing the sustainability efforts of the companies.


With the described findings, this research is contributing to the already existing but limited number of literature that is exploring the relationship between sustainability and profitability in the oil-and-gas industry in the region.
